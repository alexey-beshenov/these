# LaTeX source for “Zeta-values of arithmetic schemes at negative integers and Weil-étale cohomology”

PhD thesis by Alexey Beshenov,
advised by
Baptiste Morin (Université de Bordeaux) and
Bas Edixhoven (Universiteit Leiden).


The source files in this repository correspond to the original version of my
thesis, as it was distributed to the referees and defended in Leiden on
December 10, 2018. No mathematical or typografical modifications have been made.

Here is a very short list of misprints that I've noticed:

* Equation (0.3.2): “∃!h” should be “∃h”

* First equation in section 0.4: “P<sub>•</sub>” should be “P<sup>•</sup>”

* Section 0.9: a more correct title would be “Modified étale cohomology with
  compact support”, or “à la Zink” (cf. Appendix 2 to K. Haberland, *Galois
  cohomology of algebraic number fields* (1978)).

* Equation in Remark 0.9.2: “*” should better be “•”

* End of section 0.11: “Fact 0.11.1” should be “Fact 0.11.12”
  (fixed in the LaTeX source)

* Section 1.4, paragraph before equation (1.4.1):
  “Theéorème 5.1” should be “Théorème 5.1”

* Section 2.2: the map RΓ(X<sub>ét</sub>, -) → RΓ(X<sub>Zar</sub>, -)
  that is used to define the regulator goes in the wrong direction.
