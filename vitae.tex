Alexey Beshenov was born in 1989 in Lipetsk, USSR. He studied there at the
Liceum N. 44 in a class with specialization in mathematics and physics.

In 2006--2010 he obtained a bachelor degree in computer programming at the
Lipetsk Polytechnic University.

In order to study mathematics, he moved to Saint Petersburg, where in 2010--2012
he finished the master program in theoretical computer science at the University
of the Russian Academy of Sciences, curated by the Laboratory of Mathematical
Logic of the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute. Under supervision
of \personality{Dmitri\u{\i} Pasechnik} he defended his thesis on algorithmic
aspects of real algebraic geometry.

In 2012 Alexey was awarded an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to study at the
University of Milan and University of Bordeaux within the ALGANT Master program,
whose main focus is geometry and number theory. He obtained a master degree in
pure mathematics in 2014 and defended his thesis on Borel's results on algebraic
$K$-theory of number rings, advised by \personality{Boas Erez}.

Again supported by an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, he did his PhD studies at the
University of Bordeaux and Universiteit Leiden in 2014--2017 under direction of
\personality{Baptiste Morin} and \personality{Bas Edixhoven}.
